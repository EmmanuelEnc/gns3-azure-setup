# ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfaedef5-a483-432f-874f-0b2ff48b3497) GNS3 Azure Setup 

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy and configure a cloud-hosted GNS3 server on an Ubuntu virtual machine in Microsoft Azure. The GNS3 server enables remote network simulation, allowing users to design, test, and manage virtual network topologies using the GNS3 GUI installed on a local Windows system.

By hosting GNS3 in the cloud, this setup enables persistent and scalable network emulation without the limitations of local machine resources. It's ideal for students, network engineers, and cybersecurity professionals who want a flexible lab environment accessible from anywhere.

This project showcases essential skills in cloud infrastructure provisioning, network simulation, remote system administration, and GNS3 platform configuration, and serves as a foundation for building more complex labs involving routing, security monitoring, and system integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è To Replicate This Project:

### üìç Step 1: Plan Network Layout
- Created a new **Virtual Network (VNet)** named `CloudNetops360-VNet` with address space `10.0.0.0/16`.  

![vnet](https://i.imgur.com/bSfbWSZ.png)
- Created a subnet named `GNS3-Net` within the VNet using address range `10.0.100.0/24`.  

![subnet](https://i.imgur.com/rquGsUn.png)
- This subnet is dedicated to the GNS3 VM.

### üìç Step 2: Deploy the GNS3 VM on Azure
- Launched a new virtual machine:
  - OS: **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Server)**
  - VM Size: **Standard E2s_v3** (2 vCPU, 16GB RAM ‚Äì supports nested virtualization and Docker)
  - Assigned to subnet: **GNS3-Net**
  - Assigned a **static private IP**: `10.0.100.4`
  - Attached a **public IP** to enable remote access

### üìç Step 3: Configure Network Security Group (NSG)
Created an NSG with the following inbound rules:

| Priority | Name             | Port(s)    | Protocol | Source        | Destination | Action | Purpose                                  |
|----------|------------------|------------|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| 100      | Allow-SSH        | 22         | TCP      | My Public IP   | Any         | Allow  | SSH access to VM                         |
| 110      | Allow-GNS3-API   | 3080       | TCP      | My Public IP   | Any         | Allow  | Remote GNS3 GUI to connect               |
| 120      | Allow-GNS3-Ports | 2000‚Äì5000  | TCP/UDP  | My Public IP   | Any         | Allow  | Device communication (Dynamips, QEMU)   |
| 130      | Allow-ICMP       | *          | ICMP     | My Public IP   | Any         | Allow  | Ping testing                             |
| 1000     | Deny-All         | *          | *        | Any            | Any         | Deny   | Block all other traffic (default deny)   |

### üìç Step 4: SSH into VM & Install GNS3 + Dependencies
Connected to VM via SSH:
```bash
ssh gns3-admin@<AzurePublicIP>
```
Ran the following setup:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gns3/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gns3-server docker.io ubridge
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo usermod -aG ubridge $USER
newgrp docker
newgrp ubridge
```

### üìç Step 5: Configure GNS3 Server for Remote Access
Created the GNS3 server config:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/GNS3
nano ~/.config/GNS3/gns3_server.conf
```
Added this configuration:
```ini
[Server]
host = 0.0.0.0
port = 3080
local = True
```
Started the GNS3 server:
```bash
gns3server &
```

### üìç Step 6: Pull Docker Images (for testing)
```bash
docker pull alpine
docker pull ubuntu
docker pull busybox
```

### üìç Step 7: Setup GNS3 GUI on Local Windows PC
- Downloaded GNS3 from https://gns3.com/software/download
- Installed only the **GNS3 GUI**, skipping GNS3 VM and emulators
- Added remote server in:
  - **Edit > Preferences > Server > Remote Server**
  - Host: Azure VM Public IP
  - Port: 3080
  - Marked as **Main Server**

### üìç Step 8: Validate Remote Connection
- Opened GNS3 GUI
- Created a new project
- Successfully added Docker containers (alpine, ubuntu) and VPCS nodes
- Started devices and confirmed functionality
- Verified logs on server and ensured `gns3server` responded without error

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to set up a cloud-hosted GNS3 server in Azure for remote network simulation and testing. From provisioning the virtual machine and configuring secure access, to installing GNS3, Docker, and essential dependencies, every step was designed to establish a scalable and accessible virtual lab environment.

By decoupling the simulation engine from local hardware limitations, this setup provides a reliable platform for experimenting with routing, switching, network segmentation, and protocol testing ‚Äî all from a remote GNS3 GUI. Whether used for learning, certification prep, or prototyping, this architecture lays the groundwork for future expansion into more advanced networking or cybersecurity projects.
